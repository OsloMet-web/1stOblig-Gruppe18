    <p>My old high school had a very small gymnasium, so we always had to travel to another sports hall nearby for gym classes. The other students could travel by bike, but I had to walk because I lived further away and have to take the bus to school. I had a vey bad sense of direction and got lost the first few times travelling there.</p>
