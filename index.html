    <h2>Gruppe konflikter</h2>
        <p>If someone in the group is sick or occupied with something else
        important there will be an understandment, and if it is possible, 
        we can just push the deadline the group mutually set. And if there 
        is a physical meeting they can just communicate through zoom or even 
        send in a document of their work. But If someone is constantly missing
        meeting and not sharing their assigned work we canâ€™t really put their 
        name on the work.
