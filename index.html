    <h2>Gruppe konflikter</h2>
        <p>If someone in the group is sick or occupied with something else
        important there will be an understandment, and if it is possible, 
        we can just push the deadline the group mutually set. And if there 
        is a physical meeting they can just communicate through zoom or even 
        send in a document of their work. But If someone is constantly missing
        meeting and not sharing their assigned work we canâ€™t really put their 
        name on the work.

    <h2>Pros and cons working in groups</h2>
        <p>Working in small groups can benefit each member of the group in an impactful way. First of all, you get to know new people. 
            These people might be a key to a good network, or good to have as friends in your life. 
            Now that you have made new friends within the group, you can divide the workload evenly between each group member. 
            Dividing the workload gives you more time to finish a project, as you are not on your own. 
            When working within a small group on the same project, even though each member has a different role, or part of the project,
            it is quite hard to get stuck when working on a project, as each member of the group will inspire you, or elaborate your ideas. </p>
        <p>When you are working in a group with others, you are dependent on their cooperative ability. If someone is not cooperative, the other group member may have a hard time fulfilling their role.
            Complex problems can lead to multiple disagreements, and lead to a conflict that could exceed the actual problem. 
            It becomes very important that individuals show up to group meetings. If multiple people can not or do not show up, 
            solutions, questions and answers may be repeated multiple times and leave less time to work on the assignment.
